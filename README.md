# ToDoListAPI
This is a project made to evaluate my programming skills. 


The project wasn't finished. I tried to add new features on this to show a little bit about what I know. I'm still learning and improving. I added a little of responsive design and used a palette for the colours.

I didn't add var with the colours for the CSS but I wanted to do it. No functionality on the project but my code will be there. You can have an idea my logic and process. 

With this to-do list you will find a pic and info in the profile section just to show information since I couldn't get it with the API. Also, you will check the information to create a task and there is a section code 
in the HTML that will show you the card with the task as the doc said and I couldn't make it work with JS to show a new "task created" since I ran out of time. 

Please, do not hesitate to provide any feedback that you would like to give. I'm willing to learn and improve and your feedback will help me. 


Thank you so much for the opportunity. 

Greetings.
